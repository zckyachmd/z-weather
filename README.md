# üå¶Ô∏è Z-Weather

Z-Weather is a lightweight project designed to collect weather data, such as temperature üå°Ô∏è and humidity üíß, using an ESP8266 module and a DHT22 sensor. The gathered data is sent to an MQTT server in real-time. This project includes a range of professional features, including a WiFi Manager, MQTT configuration, convenient mDNS access, and a Web UI for device control and monitoring.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **WiFi Configuration Manager**: Easily configure WiFi credentials via a dedicated Web UI interface.
- **mDNS Integration**: Seamless device access using a local domain, e.g., `z-weather.local`.
- **Persistent Settings Storage**: MQTT configurations are saved to EEPROM, ensuring stability across reboots.
- **Dynamic Web UI**: Access to device monitoring, MQTT configuration, and resetting settings.
- **Real-Time MQTT Support**: Automatically sends weather data to an MQTT server for efficient integration.

## üöÄ How to Use

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Installation
1. Connect the ESP8266 module to your computer.
2. Install the ESP8266 board package in the Arduino IDE:
   - Open **File > Preferences** and add `http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json` to the **Additional Board Manager URLs**.
   - Go to **Tools > Board > Boards Manager**, search for `ESP8266`, and click **Install**.
3. Select the **Generic ESP8266 Module** board from the **Tools > Board** menu.
4. Install the required libraries listed in the **Libraries and Dependencies** section.
5. Open the project code in Arduino IDE and upload it to the ESP8266 module.
6. Once uploaded, the device is ready to use.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Initial Setup
1. Power on the ESP8266 device running the Z-Weather firmware.
2. The device will create a default WiFi network:
   - **SSID**: `Z-Weather`
   - **Password**: `zweather`

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Configure WiFi
1. Connect your device to the default `Z-Weather` WiFi network.
2. Open a browser and navigate to `192.168.4.1` to access the configuration page.
3. Select the desired WiFi network, enter the password if required, and save the settings.
4. Upon successful connection, the default WiFi network will disappear, and the device will connect to the configured network.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Access the Web UI
1. Ensure your device is on the same WiFi network as the ESP8266.
2. Access the device using the domain: `z-weather.local`.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Configure MQTT
1. Open the Web UI by navigating to `z-weather.local/config`.
2. Enter the MQTT server details, including server address, username, and password (if applicable).
3. Save the configuration to start sending weather data to the MQTT server.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Monitor and Reset
- Use the Web UI to monitor device status and sensor data.
- Reset configurations from the Web UI if necessary.

## üìã Important Notes
- The domain `z-weather.local` can only be accessed if your device supports **mDNS** and is connected to the same WiFi network as the ESP8266.
- Ensure that your MQTT server is operational and ready to receive data from Z-Weather.
